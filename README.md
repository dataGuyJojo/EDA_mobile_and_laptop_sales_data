# üß† Advanced (3 questions)

1. **Which month had the highest total sales revenue?**
    
    (Revenue = Price √ó Quantity Sold, group by month)

| Month Name     | Quantity Sold | Revenue (Formatted_str) |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| August 2023    | 12,224         | ‡ß≥1,273,073,633           |

2. **Compare the sales performance of 'i7' vs 'Ryzen 7' processors.**
    
    (Total quantity sold or revenue)

    **Ans:** Ryzen 7 sold more units. But i7 generated more Revenue

| **Processor** | **Quantity Sold** | **Revenue** |

| **i7** | 16913 | 1769318353 |
| **Ryzen 7** | 17300 | 1743525557 |

<br>
    

3. **Do laptops or mobile phones have a higher average dispatch delay?**
    
    (Calculate days between *Inward Date* and *Dispatch Date*)
    (Calculate days between *Inward Date* and *Dispatch Date*)

**Ans:** Both have similar dispatch delay (Avg. (Inward date - Dispatch Date)) and similar Standard Deviation. But Laptop has slightly more delay and more std deviation

| **Product** | **Average Delay** | **Std Deviation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Laptop** | 30.599 | 17.385 |
| **Mobile Phone** | 30.586 | 17.260 |
